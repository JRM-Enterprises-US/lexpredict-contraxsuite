## Introduction to Document Explorer

The Document Explorer extracts many different types of data from your contracts that you can use in a variety of ways. The following types of "entities" are all extracted by the Document Explorer:

* Dates
* Date Durations
* Terms
* Definitions
* Parties
* Geographies
* Amounts
* Currencies
* Citations to laws (*e.g.*, "CCPA" or "GDPR")
* Regulations (*e.g.*, Titles of the U.S. Code)
* Percents
* Ratios
* Trademarks
* URLs
* Courts
* Copyrights
* Distances

When you first enter the Document Explorer, you will see a home page ("LexNLP Extracted Values") displaying each type of data entity. Each entity has between 2 and 4 different buttons associated with it. Clicking these buttons will navigate you to various "Entity Usage Lists". These Entity Usage Lists can be viewed for a single project, or any number of projects. To select which projects to view Entity Usages for, use the "Project Selection" form at the top right of the screen.
