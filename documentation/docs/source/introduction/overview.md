## LexPredict Overview

LexPredict was first incorporated in 2013 as Quantitative Legal Solutions, a client service company. The company began developing its first software and data products in 2014, and re-branded to LexPredict that same year.

LexPredict is an enterprise legal technology and consulting firm, part of the [Elevate](https://elevateservices.com/) family of businesses. Our personnel specialize in legal analytics, legal data science and training, risk management, and legal data strategy consulting. We work with corporate legal departments, law firms of all sizes, financial institutions, and other conglomerates to empower better organizational decision-making by improving processes, technology, and the ways people interact with both. We developed ContraxSuite to assist organizations with contract analytics and workflows, using the best machine learning techniques, as well as our own natural language library for legal-specific text, [LexNLP](https://contraxsuite.com/lexnlp/).

## Use Cases

ContraxSuite can help organizations extract information and build custom document analytics to solve a wide range of problems. It's virtually impossible to create an exhaustive list of all of ContraxSuite's use cases, but below we highlight some of the most common.

* **Contract Identification and Organization**: No one knows where *all* of their contracts are. ContraxSuite and LexNLP can help identify unstructured data from sources like shared drives, email accounts, and contract management systems, and then tag contracts for easy organization.
* **Contract Harmonization**: There are many ways to write a clause, and there are even more ways to assemble several clauses into a contract. Contract clutter is a serious problem, and contract consistency is a must. ContraxSuite and LexNLP were built for contract harmonization projects. Match changes in historical paper or slice and dice contracts at the document, section, or clause level. LexNLP can quickly find outliers, anomalies, and other unique language or terms. When you're done, you can then use ContraxSuite to help drive and validate convergence in ongoing contracting.
* **Due Diligence and M&A**: Doing business around the world can be great. Missing law, regulations, and gepolitical risks, on the other hand, *isn't* great. LexNLP identifies risks in contract language, and when a little extra review is necessary, LexNLP can analyze communications and other documents, conducting *pre*-discovery, not just e-discovery.
* **Real Estate and Lease Abstraction**: ContraxSuite and LexNLP can help make sure you understand the restrictions and terms across your real estate and lease portfolios.
* **Finance and Capital Markets**: Identify key financial terms like currency amounts, percentages, rates, and ratios. Find borrowing spreads over LIBOR, leverage ratios in warehouses, and transaction fees. LexNLP can also process documents and agreements like offering and private placement memoranda (OCs, OMs, PPMs), ISDAs, CSAs, ED and PB agreements, and much more. 
* **Supply Chain and Vendor Management**: Sort through new risks and regulatory trends that emerge. Look for things like cyber insurance for Canadian vendors, BAAs for all US facilities, mandatory notice and cooperation clauses for FCPA violations, GDPR or CCPA frameworks, to name just a few examples.
* **Complaint and Settlement Analysis**: Many organizations have massive amounts of unstructured data like demand letters, complaints, and settlement agreements. These documents are not usually searchable or structured, but they contain a trove of valuable data. Tools like LexNLP can uncover and organize this treasure trove, and build strategic analytics to support practices like product liability, professional liability, and labor and employment.
* **Lease Accounting**: Using LexNLP, alongside machine learning tools combined with pre-trained financial and accounting models, you can quickly classify leases and lease terms like term, maintenance, transfer, and purchase rights.

## LexNLP

*[Click here for LexNLP documentation](http://publicdocs.contraxsuite.com/lexnlp/index.html)*

LexNLPâ„¢ by LexPredict is the leading open source information retrieval and extraction tool for real, unstructured legal text. LexNLP is for developers and other parties who need to solve problems involving contracts, plans, policies, procedures, and other material. Developers and other parties can use LexNLP to build their own solutions, or extract custom data from legal or financial documents. Corporate legal departments, law firms, financial institutions, publicly-traded companies, insurance companies, accountants, and auditors can all benefit from LexNLP.

#### LexNLP Features

LexNLP can extract the following types of information:
* Segmentation and tokenization of common legal abbreviations like "LLC." and "F.3d", and common legal concepts like pages, titles, and sections
* Pre-trained word embedding and topic models, broadly and for specific practice areas
* Pre-trained classifiers for document type and clause type
* Tools for building new clustering and classification methods
* Hundreds of unit tests from real legal documents
* Broad range of fact extraction from legal domain-specific text, such as:
    * Monetary amounts, non-monetary amounts, percentages, ratios
    * Addresses, parties, persons, companies, telephone numbers, and email addresses
    * Conditional statements and constraints, like "less than" or "later than"
    * Dates and durations, including effective dates, termination dates, and delivery dates
    * Terms, notice periods, or assignment delays
    * References to citations or regulations like "26 U.S.C. 501," "26 CFR 31.3121," or "655 F.3d 1013"
    * Controlling law and jurisdictions
    * Copyrights and trademarks
    * Phrasal definitions like "Default shall mean..."

###### Tokenization and Segmentation

Other libraries struggle with headings and sections, or they stumble over common abbreviations like "U.S.C." LexNLP tokenizes and segments, leaving nothing behind:

* Pages, paragraphs, and sentences
* Tokens, stems, and stopwords
* Titles, articles, sections
* Exhibits and schedules
* Tables of contents

###### Clustering and Classification

LexNLP can cluster and classify data in intuitive ways:

* Sentences, paragraphs, clauses, sections, and documents
* Documents as legal or non-legal material
* Documents as financial or non-financial material
* Contracts among various contract types
* Clauses among various clause types
* By using deep semantic models to find synonyms or related concepts
